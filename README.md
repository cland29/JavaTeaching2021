# JavaTeaching2021
A repo of teaching assignments for getting students up to par on java concepts.
 
## Disclaimer
This repo is in constant iteration, and is considered a living document. Thus, it should in no way be considered complete. Unless it's a tuesday at 2:34 am. Then it is temporarily considered undead, and you should prepare you holy water just incase.

## Scenarios
Jeff the left handed CS teacher is wakes up on a tuesday morning. He finds his toaster isn't working. That's a shame. What isn't a shame? Jeff is prepared for school, because he recently downloaded the a fancy new repo to teach his students. He uses git classroom to copy this template repo, and his student, Franny, Danny, Manny, and Oscar can then copy open their own repos, reading the thinkjava book as well as working through the exercises. Jeff can choose whether he wants to teach the lessons directly, or, on this particular day, let the students do it all alone, because he is feeling paticularly drained (probably from lack of toast.)

Piff is a young and up and coming CS student. His school doesn't have any CS courses, so he decides to learn himself. He finds this repo and clones it, then gets to work learning.

Jackie is constantly try her best to make sure her classroom students are working at the correct pass. Unfortunately for her, Big Brained Bobby and Miniscule Minded Mindy are in her class. Since Bobby has so much in his brain, he didn't have much room for CS, so isn't ready to move on to the harder things. Mindy on the other hand absorbs CS speedy quick and did coding by herself, so she's ahead. Jackie chooses to use this repo to so that students can do challenges at their own pace while she helps individual students with their needs.

## Non-goals
In this current iteration of the repo, we will **not** include the following:

git classroom auto checking
free penguins

## Overview
The purpose of this repo is to create an educational enviroment for FRC 1646 to learn java code. Each section will be labeled with markdown files (mainly because we ran out of crayons). Students can fork the repo, but pull requests should only be accepted to fix an aspect of the repo, and not to pull in student code (Looking at you, Jeff, sheesh). Each project goal will be written like a spec in order to help prepare students for understanding how to read one. Finally, there will be a dramatic overarching story about evil polar bears. We might even include a really good tomato soup recipe if you're lucky.

Each exercise will cover one aspect of coding. It will closely follow the book *How to Think Like a Computer Scientist* or, more simply, *ThinkJava*

## Open Issues
Uh... There isn't much code yet?

## Sidenote
If you haven't laughed yet, you have no sense of humor. 

Seriously though. No one reads this if it isn't somewhat humorous.

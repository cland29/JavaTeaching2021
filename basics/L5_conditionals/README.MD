## Scenario


## Overview
In this section, we will start to learn about Datatypes. 

### 4.0
Read Chapter 2 of ThinkJava

### 4.1 
Create a int variable called "popcorn = 2". Print it out. Then use the "+" operator to increase it by one. Then print it out. 

Now, multiple it by two using the "*" operator. Print it out.

Finally, use the Math.pow() on the variable popcorn to square it. Then print it out.

### 4.2
Aligators for sale! Print out how much your alligator cost (from a past exercise).

Now, multiply the cost of the alligator by 1.07 to account for sales tax.

Now, multiple the cost by 0.5. Make a sales pitch about you aligator being 50% off, then print the new cost.

### 4.3
Create a program that has:
* int alligators
* int crocdiles
Use the >, <, >=, <=, ==, != operators to print out the number of alligators compared to the number of crocodiles. Write a comment explaining what each of these does.

For example:

int alligators = 2

int crocodiles = 3

System.out.println(alligators > crocodiles)

### 4.4
Create a program that has:
* boolean isBillyAnAlligator
* boolean isCindyAnAlligator
We will be using the && (and) operator and the || (or) operator to compare these. 

For example:

boolean isBillyAnAlligator = false

boolean isCindyAnAlligator = true

System.out.println(isBillyAnAlligator && isCindyAnAlligator)



### 4.4
Create a calculator that uses x and y variables as variables.

You will then output the following:
* x + y
* x - y
* x * y
* x / y
* x % y
* x > y
* x < y
* x == y
* x != y


It should be output in the following format:

x = 3, y = 2

x + y = 5

x - y = 1

(continues this pattern for the rest of the program)

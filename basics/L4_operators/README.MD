## Scenario


## Overview
In this section, we will start to learn about Datatypes. 

### 4.0
Read Chapter 2 of ThinkJava

### 4.1 
Create a int variable called "popcorn = 2". Print it out. Then use the "+" operator to increase it by one. Then print it out. 

Now, multiple it by two using the "*" operator. Print it out.

Finally, use the Math.pow() on the variable popcorn to square it. Then print it out.

### 4.2
Aligators for sale! Print out how much your alligator cost (from a past exercise).

Now, multiple the cost of the alligator by 1.07 to account for sales tax.

Now, multiple the cost by 0.5. Make a sales pitch about you aligator being 50% off, then print the new cost.

### 4.3
Create a program that:
* Uses a boolean to whether or not it's the apocalypse (False)
* Print out "Is it the apocalypse?" then print out your boolean
* Print out "Wait, are those... killer space worms?"
* Change your boolean to value to true
* Print out "Is it the apocalypse?" then print out your boolean

### 4.4
The alligator market is crazy! Crazy low low prices!
Print out the value of your alligators. Then set the value to 100 dollars less. Then print it out. Then 100 less. Then print. Keep going until you are literally giving people money to take your alligators. 
Note to educators: Don't use loops. I know, crazy right? Like these prices!

## Scenario
Jimmy wants to be able specify how many chickens he needs to eat to beat the world record. He decides to write a program, but wants to make it be able to use any food group a user were to enter. Jimmy decides to use a Scanner to take in input.

## Overview
In this section, we will start to learn about Scanner input. 

### 3.1
Read Chapter 3 of ThinkJava

### 3.2 
Create a program that asks the user for their name, age, and then number of pickles they have eaten today. Then, tell the world about it!

`What is your name?`

`Input: Carl`

`What is your age?`

`Input 22`

`How many pickles have you eaten today?`

`input: 7`

`Hey everyone! Carl is 22 and he has only eaten 7 pickles today!`

### 3.3
Create a madlibs program that tell a legend about a great battle between an evil polar bear named *Flark* and *Panao*, a legendary penguin hero. The program should ask for 3 different inputs. The story should be about a paragraph, and end on a cliff hanger. Below is an example:

`Give me something you can eat:`

`Input: carrot`

`Tell me an exciting sound:`

`input: Yahoooo!`

`What's the name of you favorite baseball team?`>`

`input: The Cardinels`

`Pando breathed a gasping sigh. Flark's **carrot** had just dug deep into his side. "Ha ha, you are no match for me!" yelled flark. Suddenly, the was a loud screeching "**Yahooooo!**!" and a thud. Suddenly Pando was surrounded in **The Cardinels**, and nether him nor Flark were ever seen again.`

### 3.4
Create a calculator program that takes in 2 integers *a* and *b* and prints out additon, subtraction, multiplaction, division, and modulo. Below is an example if a user input *a* as 7 and *b* as 11. The program should prompt the user for *a* and *b* by asking for them.

`What is a?`

`Input: 7`

`What is b?`

`Input: 11`

`a + b = 18`

`a - b = -4`

`a * b = 77`

`a / b = 0`

`a % b = 7`

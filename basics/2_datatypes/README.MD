## Scenario
Jacky wants to be able to save a record of the number of alligators he has at any given time. He uses a variable of String type to save the name, a int the save the quantity, and a double to record their price, and boolean to record if they have lasers or not.

## Overview
In this section, we will start to learn about Datatypes. 

### 2.0
Read Chapter 2 of ThinkJava

### 2.1 
Create a int object of the number of alligators your have and a double object for how much you are willing to sell it for. Print out a snappy sales pitch for your alligator.

### 2.2
Create a three String objects that has the name of your 3 favorite birds. Print then out in a flamboiant way. (Preferable with lots of sass.)

### 2.3
Create a program that:
* Uses a boolean to whether or not it's the apocalypse (False)
* Print out "Is it the apocalypse?" then print out your boolean
* Print out "Wait, are those... killer space worms?"
* Change your boolean to value to true
* Print out "Is it the apocalypse?" then print out your boolean

### 2.4
The alligator market is crazy! Crazy low low prices!
Print out the value of your alligators. Then set the value to 100 dollars less. Then print it out. Then 100 less. Then print. Keep going until you are literally giving people money to take your alligators.
